# UX FED Assessment

This project uses [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/) to automate SCSS pre-processing.

### Getting Started

Install dependencies by entering `npm i` or `npm install` in a command prompt (Windows) or terminal (macOS/Linux) window.

There are two gulp tasks currently setup, `default` and `build`. The default task (run by entering `npm start`) processes SCSS files and watches for any changes, then refreshes the browser. The build task (run by entering `npm run build`) only processes SCSS files with no watch functionality.
